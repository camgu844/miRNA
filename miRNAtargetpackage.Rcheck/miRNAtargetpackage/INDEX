as.list.targetHub       Function that creates a list from a targetHub
                        object.
miRNA_target_interactions
                        targetHub is a database of miRNA-mRNA
                        interactions. The interaction data is obtained
                        various external data sources and in some cases
                        computed in-house by algorithms implemented for
                        miRNA target prediction. Note: the include_docs
                        option is always TRUE
miRNAtargetpackage-package
                        Package for finding miRNA-mRNA interactions.
parse_response          Function that checks the status and parses the
                        response.
print.targetHub         Function that prints the interactions.
